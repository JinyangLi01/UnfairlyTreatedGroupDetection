# Things to include
1. 1-2 slides of motivation
2. 

# outline in 10 points
1. motivation: machine learning suffers from fairness issues
2. for example, ... 
3. we design a system to find out patterns treated unfairly
4. concept of pattern and count, and what we output
5. run the system, select or upload dataset, fairness definition, classifier
6. choose our own parameters: threshold
7. output contains ...
8. The two patterns in the output imply these two groups people are treated unfairly
9. change parameters, we get different results
10. The different results imply that ... eg, group A's size is larger than 10 but smaller than 30, so it only appears in the second experiment

- errors in output when changing thresholds?
  * because output size need to be decided beforehand. Now it's 100 rows.
- add size and fairness values after each pattern in the output
  * done:)
- add preview table
- add check boxes of attributes
- slider for fairness delta, up and down integers for size threshold
  * done
- clear output when setting new thresholds
  * done
